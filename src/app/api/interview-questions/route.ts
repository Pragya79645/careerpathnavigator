üéØ **FLASHCARD MODE - TECHNICAL QUESTIONS**

Create FLASHCARD-STYLE technical questions perfect for quick revision:

QUESTION FORMAT:
- Short, focused questions on key technical concepts
- Target core knowledge areas that are frequently tested
- Use clear, direct language
- Example: "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?" instead of "Explain the networking protocols"

ANSWER FORMAT (A+ Explanations):
- Start with a clear, concise definition
- Use bullet points for key differences or features
- Include practical examples or use cases
- Add memory aids or mnemonics where helpful
- End with a key takeaway or summary point
- Structure: Definition ‚Üí Key Points ‚Üí Example ‚Üí Takeaway

EXAMPLE FLASHCARD STRUCTURE:
Question: "What is Big O notation?"
Answer: 
‚Ä¢ Definition: Mathematical notation describing algorithm efficiency
‚Ä¢ Key aspects:
  - Time complexity: How runtime scales with input size
  - Space complexity: How memory usage scales
‚Ä¢ Common complexities: O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n¬≤) < O(2^n)
‚Ä¢ Example: Binary search is O(log n), bubble sort is O(n¬≤)
‚Ä¢ Memory aid: "Big O = Order of growth"
‚Ä¢ Takeaway: Always analyze both time and space complexity
